 1. write a program for the shipping info that, the program should ask:
                    building number ( nextInt() )
                            nextLine()
                    Street address (Assume it has more than one word) ( nextLine() )
                    city name (nextLine() )
                    state name ( next() )
                    zip code ( nextInt() )
                            nextLine()
                    full name of the person ( nextLine() )
            and prints the ship to info in the following format:
            ex output:
                    Ship To:  Jimmy joe
                              7925 Jones Branch Dr
